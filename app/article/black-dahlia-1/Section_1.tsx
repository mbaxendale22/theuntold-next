            <h3>The investigation</h3>
            <p>
                Short was dead approximately for 10 hours prior to her body
                being discovered at approximately 11AM, placing her time of
                death likely in the early hours of January 15
                <sup>th</sup>. Given the elaborate mutilation, sodomy,
                exsanguination, and placing of the body it is likely that the
                murderer(s) has been at work throughout the night to complete
                their work by morning of the 15
                <sup>th</sup>. It was concluded that the body had been staged
                later than 2AM (based on the morning dew found under it).
                Witnesses walked past the lot where the body was found as late
                as 8:30AM without making the discovery, despite it being
                positioned only 3,6 meters away from the sidewalk. A partial
                footprint, tire tracks, and a cement sack containing watery
                blood were found nearby.

                The last confirmed sighting of Short was in the late hours of 9
                <sup>th</sup> of January, leaving almost a week unaccounted for.
                Short was last seen by Robert "Red" Manley, a 25-year-old
                married salesman she had been dating who left her at the
                Biltmore hotel on the 9<sup>th</sup>, after giving her a ride to
                LA from San Diego. Short told him she will be meeting her sister
                who was visiting from Boston at the Biltmore. This was likely
                not the truth, as it has not been corroborated by the sister. By
                some accounts, although this had been called into question,
                staff of the Biltmore recalled having seen Short using the lobby
                telephone. Shortly after, she was allegedly seen by patrons of
                the Crown Grill Cocktail Lounge at 754 South Olive Street,
                approximately (600 m) away from the Biltmore.

                It is not known who Short called from the lobby of the Biltmore.
                Mark Hansen, a Hollywood nightclub owner at whose house Short
                had intermittently lived and who became a suspect in the
                investigation, provided a confusing and contradictory testimony
                regarding this call. Hansen stated that Short had called him on
                the evening of the 9<sup>th</sup> to ask whether she could
                temporarily reside at his home. It’s not a matter of public
                record what Hansen replied but he gave contrasting accounts
                stating both that he did allow Short to stay but she never
                arrived at his home. And that he declined to help her as he was
                at the time residing with Short’s close friend Anne Toth who
                would have disliked that arrangement.

                On January 21<sup>st</sup> 1947, a person claiming to be Short’s
                killer called the office of the editor of the LA Examiner
                voicing their approval of the Examiner’s covering of the story
                and announcing the arrival of “some souvenirs of Beth Short in
                the mail”. Three days later a package posted to the Examiner and
                other news outlets continuing Short’s personal belongings (birth
                certificate, business cards, photographs, names written on
                pieces of paper, and an address book with the name Mark Hansen
                embossed on the cover) was discovered. The packet has been
                scrubbed clean with gasoline. Several partial fingerprints were
                lifted but they were compromised in transit and not able to be
                properly analyzed. On the same day, Short’s suede handbag and a
                single shoe were found 3km from the crime scene. These were also
                whipped clean with gasoline. On January 26
                <sup>th</sup>
                another letter arrived stating the time and place where the
                sender will surrender themselves to the Police. Police waited in
                vain at the location. Instead, at 1PM, the <i>Examiner</i>{' '}
                offices received a further letter which read: "Have changed my
                mind. You would not give me a square deal. Dahlia killing was
                justified."

                Police quickly deemed Mark Hansen, whose address book had been
                found amongst the items sent, a viable suspect. He remained a
                prime suspect until as late as 1951, but was eventually cleared
                of suspicion. In the ensuing weeks, Police investigated around
                150 men, including Robert Manley and other men whose contacts
                were found amongst Short’s belongings. Numerous locations across
                LA were searched, yielding no additional evidence. By the spring
                of 1947, Short's murder had become a cold case with few new
                investigative avenues.
