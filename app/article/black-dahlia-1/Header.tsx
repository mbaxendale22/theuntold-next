                    On the cold winter morning of January 15<sup>th</sup> 1947,
                    a young mother was on her way to a shoe repair shop with her
                    3-year-old daughter when she spotted in the grass what
                    appeared to be a discarded mannequin. Ruble and trash
                    abandoned roadside was not an uncommon scene in the area –
                    the Leimert Park district of LA, a then partially developed
                    suburban zone – and this stretch of the road was known as a
                    lovers’ lane. As the approached the scene, the woman
                    realized she had come across the severed naked body of young
                    Elizabeth Short, 22 at the time. An hour later, dozens of
                    LAPD detectives and media descended on the site ushering in
                    a national furor over the shocking and brutal murder.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Short died of blunt force trauma to the head and
                    blood loss due to gashes from both corners of her mouth to
                    her ears – a <i>Glasgow smile</i>. Her stomach was filled
                    with unknown green-brown granular material and feces,
                    prompting some to stipulate that she had been forced to eat
                    this. Her body was cut into two at her waist and carefully
                    positioned, her intestines tucked neatly beneath her
                    buttocks. The hemicorporectomy, which is a surgical
                    procedure of cutting through the second and third lumbar
                    vertebrae to avoid cutting through bones, was carried out
                    with great precision. There were numerous lacerations
                    inflicted to Short’s body and face. Her right breast was
                    removed, there was a large cut from her umbilical to
                    supra-pubic area, a large incision to her left thigh where
                    she had a red rose tattooed with flesh removed and inserted
                    into her vagina, a precise triangular incision near left
                    nipple, scalpel lacerations to upper lip, and numerous
                    lacerations to her vagina. She was sodomized using an
                    unknown object and raped post-mortem. Her body was drained
                    of blood and scrubbed clean with gasoline before being
                    staged at Leimert Park.
                    <br />
                    <br /> In the days and months following the discovery of
                    Short’s body, a frenzied media circus ensued. The killing
                    was front page news for 35 days. The
                    <i>Herald-Express</i> and its owner William Randolph Hearst
                    spearheaded what was in essence a sensationalist smearing
                    campaign against Short. She was portrayed as a prostitute
                    and a woman leading a promiscuous lifestyle, an
                    "adventuress" who "prowled Hollywood Boulevard". The media
                    went as far as to report Short was last seen wearing a tight
                    skirt and sheer black blouse, rather than a black suit and
                    white blouse. Black Dahlia was a moniker for Short,
                    allegedly inspired by the movie The Blue Dahlia and Short’s
                    love of black sheer clothing. Short was sexualized and
                    exploited by the media in a manner not unfamiliar in modern
                    times. People were transfixed by this mysterious
                    fair-skinned and beautiful young woman who came to LA in
                    pursuit of a glamourous lifestyle, just to end savagely
                    murdered and discarded like trash. In the first few months
                    of the investigation, more than 60 individuals made false
                    confessions. Today, that number is higher than 500. Hundreds
                    of people were investigated, dozens becoming official
                    suspects, but to no avail – one of the largest police
                    investigations in the history of the USA produced no results
                    and ultimately frizzled as the headline-appeal of Short
                    faded.
