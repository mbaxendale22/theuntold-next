            <h3>Sgt. Peter Anthony Vetcher</h3>
            <p>
                According to the FBI files, Short met first Sergeant Vetcher in
                LA in September of 1946. This coincided with the beginning of
                the very turbulent period of the final months in Short’s life.
                At the time Vetcher was sightseeing in LA with another officer
                (Sgt. Moffett) during a trip the purpose of which was to return
                an AWOL soldier to base. The time spent in LA was not requested
                or approved according to any official military procedures (in
                other words, it was not reflected in military records of their
                whereabouts).

            <br />
            <p>
                The following is known about Vetcher’s life: Vetcher was among
                the original First Ranger Battalion group at the Commando
                Training Depot, Achnacarry, Scotland on June 19<sup>th</sup>,
                1942. He was a member of the famed Darby Rangers. Vetcher
                himself, who was wounded twice, first in the Africa campaign and
                again in Italy, estimated that of the 500 elite soldiers, only
                43 survived the war. He was awarded the Silver Star, among other
                medals. He was held as a prisoner during the war in Stalag 3B
                near Fuerstenberg, Prussia. His capture was first reported to
                the International Committee of the Red Cross on January 30
                <sup>th</sup>, 1944. He was held prisoner for at least 526 days.
                Pete Vetcher was born in 1915 and died in 2001 (source:{' '}

                ).

            <br />
            <p>
                Vetcher’s name came to LAPD’s attention after Short’s high
                school sweetheart John P. O’Neil, who was also a soldier,
                informed them that he had received a post card from Short
                stating that she was married to Vetcher and living in LA. It was
                a several-weeks-long effort to locate and interview Vetcher
                (more about this later). He stated that he wrote to the LAPD
                making them aware of his connection to Short as he was concerned
                his name will appear in her personal belongings (!), but did not
                hear back from the Police on this matter. He was finally
                interviewed by the FBI on March 27<sup>th</sup> 1947.

            <br />

            <p>
                Vetcher was cleared of suspicion based on his military records
                even prior to this interview and as such, this interview had the
                tone of an information gathering conversation. However, looking
                at the FBI files, several pieces of information regarding
                Vetcher’s alibi stand out: Vetcher was stationed at Fort
                McLellan in Alabama (wherefrom he visited LA) until 28
                <sup>th</sup> of January 1947. He was at the time of the
                interview stationed in Harrisburg, Philadelphia as a National
                Guard instructor. Official morning records from Fort McLellan
                indicate Vetcher being present every morning from January 1
                <sup>st</sup> to January 28<sup>th</sup>. However, a document
                stating the following can also be found in the FBI files:

                        His file reflects a letter dated November twelfth, forty
                        six, from the Honorable Daniel J. Fgood, member of
                        Congress, requesting the Cooperation of the War
                        Department in the transfer of Vetcher to the National
                        Guard Unit, Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the capacity of
                        instructor stating that Vetcher had already applied for
                        transfer through official channels. It is not possible
                        to determine where Vetcher was assigned in January. The
                        latest assignment card in file dated November thirty,
                        forty six, shows Vetcher assigned Company B, twenty
                        eight infantry training battalion, Fort McLellan,
                        Alabama, however there is a letter dated February twenty

                        On September 20, 1946, he “proceeded to downtown Los
                        Angeles.” He then, “wandered around the downtown section
                        of Los Angeles until about 1:45 P. M., when he stopped
                        and stood leaning against the wall of a store on the
                        corner of what he recalls was 6th and Olive Streets.
                        While he was idly watching the passers-by, he observed
                        the victim, accompanied by another young woman [this was
                        likely Majorie Graham], walk by at about 2:00 P. M.
                        After passing him, the victim turned around and walked
                        over to Sergeant Vetcher,” and inquired about a friend
                        who had been in the service. She explained that they had
                        been “childhood sweethearts in their hometown of
                        Medford, Massachusetts.” Vetcher “stated that after this
                        conversation he inquired of the victim whether she would
                        give him a date for the evening.”

                        victim and Vetcher eventually proceeded to the Columbia
                        Broadcasting Station Studios, where they saw a Tony

                        “Thereafter they proceeded to Tom Breneman’s. Vetcher
                        stated that at the corner of Hollywood and Vine they met
                        First Sergeant Charles Moffett who accompanied them to
                        Tom Breneman’s. Upon arriving at Tom Breneman’s, they
                        observed that a number of people were waiting in line
                        for a table, but as soon as they entered the door, the
                        head waiter came over to the victim and escorted her,
                        along with Vetcher and Moffett to a nearby table.
                        Vetcher stated that during the time they were at Tom
                        Breneman’s, he observed that the victim appeared to be
                        well known to all of the waiters there.”

                        They talked again of the “childhood friend” from
                        Medford. The man reminded her that he only knew this
                        friend of hers under “combat conditions.” Lieutenant
                        John P. O’Neil was the hometown boy and Beth and Pete
                        Vetcher wrote him two postcards the next day, according
                        to Vetcher, stating they were married and living “in
                        Hollywood and very happy.” Beth signed one card Betty
                        Short Vetcher.” The sergeant “also stated that the
                        victim was very well dressed and caught the attention of
                        many of the guests at Tom Breneman’s He stated that he
                        caught snatches of conversations of people seated in the
                        immediate vicinity and heard some of them suggest that
                        she must be a professional actress employed by RKO or
                        some other studio.” According to his statement, they
                        left at about 12:30 A. M. and separated from Moffett.

                        Peter Vetcher told the special agents that they returned
                        to downtown on a trolley and as they walked about five
                        blocks from the stop, “a black car drove up beside them
                        and stopped. Vetcher stated that there were five men
                        seated in the car who appeared to be dark complexioned
                        and possibly were Mexican, three of whom jumped out of
                        the rear of the car and yelled, ‘There she is.’ Vetcher
                        stated that he suggested to the victim that he beat
                        these individuals up, but she told him the best thing to
                        do would be to run. According to the FBI report, “they
                        ran and escaped from these individuals, who apparently
                        were unknown to the victim.”

                        When they reached her hotel, Beth invited him upstairs.
                        Her roommate was working that evening and said Vetcher
                        could sleep in her bed if it was alright with Beth.
                        After sneaking into her room and making advances,
                        Vetcher said that they made love several times
                        throughout the night, but “that at no time was the
                        victim in a passionate mood, which led him to suggest
                        the possibility that she was a Lesbian.”

                    <p>
                        “In order to corroborate this statement, he pointed out
                        that during his conversations with the victim, she
                        related to him that she at one time frequently visited a
                        wealthy woman who resides either in Hollywood or Los
                        Angeles, and that this woman had made improper advances
                        towards her, which she resisted.”

                    <p>
                        Vetcher spent time with her the next day, before they
                        went their separate ways. He watched her enter the
                        Figueroa Hotel with a girl friend and “stated that as
                        the girls entered the hotel, he observed the victim in a
                        heated conversation with a short, chunky, well-dressed
                        man who appeared to be 40 or 45 years of age.” The
                        soldier said, “he had not seen the victim since that
                        time, and had never had any correspondence with her.”

                    <p>
                        The report said, “Vetcher stated that during his various
                        conversations with the victim, she never expressed fear
                        of anyone, but she did mention that Los Angeles was a
                        tough city and that it was dangerous for a girl to be
                        alone on the streets at night. She told him that she was
                        afraid to be alone on the streets at night, and while
                        they were reading a newspaper in the lobby of the
                        Figueroa Hotel, she pointed out to him an article which
                        featured a resume of the number of murders and rapes
                        which had occurred in Los Angeles over a short period of
                        time. In addition, Vetcher stated that the victim told
                        him that she was going with a man whom she did not like
                        very much, but she stated that she did not want to hurt
                        his feelings by stopping to go with him. Vetcher advised
                        that he did not know the name of this man. It may be
                        noted that Vetcher vigorously denied that he had ever
                        been married to the victim.”

                    <p>
                        “Vetcher claimed that after reading in the Birmingham,
                        Alabama newspapers that the victim had been murdered, he
                        wrote a letter to the Los Angeles Police Department
                        advising them of his meeting with the victim. Vetcher
                        stated that he feared that his name might be found in
                        the little black book of the victim’s girlfriend, and,
                        accordingly, contacted the Los Angeles Police Department

            <p>
                The above is a statement of a highly regarded and decorated
                soldier and a prisoner of war. The importance of this fact
                cannot be overstated when trying to understand why this
                statement did not result in a significant effort of looking into
                Vetcher as a suspect. In fact, there is no indication in the FBI
                files that his fingerprints were even checked against the
                partial prints lifted off the package sent to the media (this is
                something regularly done with other suspects during the
                investigation). Vetcher claimed that these two days (20-21
                <sup>st</sup>
                September 1946) were the extent of his involvement with Short.
                He requested a relocation from Alabama prior to November 20
                <sup>th</sup>
                that same year. There seems to be some level of uncertainty
                regarding his whereabouts during January 1947 and he was known
                to be living in Pennsylvania with his mother by March 1947.

                There isn’t a single element of the above statement that, in
                isolation, should raise alarms. However, the overall tone of the
                statement seems to be catering to the many problematic
                narratives about Short the Police were already entertaining.
                This, in itself, gives reason to pause. A highly organized,
                intelligent, and charming killer who has had several months to
                prepare his statement and has been following the course of the
                investigation, might know just what to say.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Perhaps the most problematic element of the statement is the
                fact that Vetcher claims to have had intercourse with Short on
                several occasions in one night. This is inconsistent with what
                is known about Short. Short has been intimate with only 3 people
                that the Police was able to verify. We’re expected to believe
                that one of them was Vetcher, a person Short knew for around 24
                hours in total during her life, and a person whose telephone or
                address were not recovered amongst Shorts belongings. Whilst it
                isn’t known who the three people Short was intimate were, it is
                likely that the other two would be individuals who she had a
                long and more meaningful relationships with (and who have also
                been accounted for in her address book). Perhaps the other two
                were Gordon Fickling, a boyfriend who she met in 1944 and who
                had lived with her in Long Beach and in Hollywood, and Matt
                Gordon, a war-pilot who she was engaged to and who died during
                deployment in 1945.

                The third person seems to have been Vetcher who, unlike many
                other men who have tried before him, managed to have intercourse
                with the ‘tease’ the Black Dahlia was said to be. Not only did
                he have intercourse with her, but it took place on multiple
                occasions over the course of one night. This sounds very
                unlikely. In fact, what’s more likely is that Vetcher had hoped
                to be intimate with Short on the night of September 20
                <sup>th</sup>, but she declined this, as she had done many times
                before and after. She might have declined him on multiple
                occasions if his relationship with Short was more extensive than
                the one day he accounted for. Being declined would have caused a
                narcissistic injury to the killer. And if he was ever providing
                the Police with a statement, he would be likely to defend
                against this by exaggerating his sexual exploits.

                But where the cunning nature of Vetcher’s statement really
                shines through is when he casts doubts regarding Short’s
                sexuality because she was “at no time” in “a passionate mood”.
                This is a brilliant ‘move’ on his part and shows that Vetcher
                really does know his audience. Firstly, Vetcher shows some
                vulnerability with this statement as he is, in essence, saying
                that he wasn’t able to satisfy Short sexually. Adding this
                element of vulnerability makes it less likely that the Police
                will question whether his statement regarding the nature of the
                intercourse was exaggerated in the first place. On the other
                hand, it also offers weight to the narrative the Police is
                already primed to take seriously – that Short was in some way
                perverted (such as by being a lesbian in the 40ies).

                Vetcher is using a similar tactic in his recounting of the
                several Mexicans who were apparently after Short. What he is
                doing here is confirming to the Police that Short was involved
                with the criminal milieu, a theory that was prominent at the
                time (one of the most pursued angles of the investigation was
                that Short has someone been involved with Hansen’s criminal
                circle). But in addition to this, he is also suggesting that
                this connection might be very hard to ‘put a finger on’ as there
                are illusive Mexicans, making the case an international mystery.

                Besides the statement, there is also the problem of Vetcher’s
                name not being accounted for in Short’s belongings and he
                himself stated that she had written it down (this is something
                Short seemed to have been doing regularly). This is to be
                expected if Vetcher is the person who assembled the package of
                Short’s belongings sent to the Police. Otherwise, it might be
                that Short simply misplaced or lost his contact. But this is
                implausible due to the very organized way in which Short was
                managing her male contacts. Not to mention the fact the Vetcher
                was someone she was (as he claims) physically intimate with.

            <br />
            <p>
                In addition, Vetcher stated that he had sent a letter to LAPD to
                declare his knowledge of Short but did not receive a reply. Two
                things about this are worth noticing. Firstly, this is a very
                clever way to orchestrate plausible deniability as the Police
                would have no way of verifying this letter was sent and Vetcher,
                being a high-ranking military personnel, most likely had a good
                sense of this and of the fact that the investigators would have
                found it plausible that a letter was lost by the Police
                department in the chaos of the massive investigation. And
                secondly, it’s not known when the letter was sent. This would be
                a significant piece of information because Vetcher was, on his
                account, stationed in Alabama in January 1947 and it would be
                possible to find out when the news of Short’s killing was
                publicized in Alabama. Vetcher sending a letter earlier than
                this would be suspicious as he seems to have no known
                connections in LA and was simply there for one day sightseeing
                in September of 1946. Therefore, Vetcher would have either been
                elsewhere than Alabama in January of 1947, or he was following
                the story because he already knew Short was deceased prior to
                the news breaking in Alabama. Clearly, Vetcher was clever enough
                elsewhere in his statement to say that he had sent the letter
                after reading about the case in “the Birmingham, Alabama
                newspapers” but didn’t seem to furnish a date when se sent the
                letter. Nor was he bothered enough to attempt to get in touch
                with the Police by other means as this large investigation was
                ongoing.

                Vetcher also made sure to furnish the Police with a number of
                other persons of interest, such as mentioning a boyfriend who
                Short said to have been afraid of whose name he couldn’t recall.
                He also stated that he dropped Short off on the 22<sup>nd</sup>{' '}
                at the Hotel Figueroa (where she and Graham was staying at the
                time) and had witnessed her having “a heated conversation with a
                short, chunky, well-dressed man who appeared to be 40 to 45
                years old”. There was also mention of a man Short had a date
                with on the might of the 22<sup>nd</sup> who had a car, but
                whose name Vetcher again couldn’t recollect. He was a very
                useful witness, indeed.{' '}
