            <h3>Modus Operandi and signature</h3>
            <p>
                The manner in which Elisabeth Short died and the socio-cultural
                context have fueled people’s interest in the case for decades.
                Several high-profile men, most notably Orson Welles and George
                Hodel have been suspected. Over the decades, there have been
                attempts to make connections between the Black Dahlia murder and
                other crimes that had captured the imagination of the masses
                (such as the Lipstick Murders, the Zodiac, the Cleveland Torso
                Murders, to name but a few). Clearly, people’s minds veered
                towards the astounding, amazing, shocking, and sensationalistic,
                perhaps in an attempt to make sense of who could possibly murder
                Short in such a gruesome way. The murder seemed to be a case of
                a <i>film noire</i> coming to life. Narratives about Short’s
                life and character have been permeating this investigation from
                the moment of the discovery of the body by an innocent mother
                and toddler is a row of suburban homes for young families. It is
                clear by the location and manner in which the body was staged
                that the killer had an intention to shock. This was accomplished
                to a degree which very likely compromised the investigation and
                any chance of discovering what happened to Short and by who’s
                hand.

                The perpetrator was doubtless an organised offender, making the
                murder likely planned and premeditated. However, this doesn’t
                imply that the victim selection was planned very much in
                advance. For example, a killer might have a very meticulous plan
                and intention but is quite opportunistic in relation to victim
                selection (e.g., Ted Bundy). An organised killer leaves at the
                scene little (unintended) evidence and exerts strong control
                over the disposal of the body. Organized criminals are
                antisocial and often have psychopathic traits, but are not
                insane. They know right from wrong and they show no remorse.
                They are likely to be intelligent, attractive, in a stable
                relationship, educated and employed, orderly, well-spoken,
                charming, manipulative, and controlled. They are aware of their
                ability to hide in plain sight and will, at times, gain great
                narcissistic pleasure from tainting police by sending letters to
                the media or inserting themselves in other ways into the
                investigation. Due to their sense of superiority, they will most
                likely follow the media reports of their crimes and will often
                make their thoughts about media coverage and the Police’s
                inability to solve the crimes known by boasting in their
                correspondence to the media. Ted Budy, John Wayne Gacy, and
                Dennis Rader are prime examples of organised killers.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The Black Dahlia case has all the characteristics of an
                organized killer who uses the media to insert themselves into
                the investigation and reduce police morale and efficiency.
                However, by this logic, we must assume that the killer took
                great care in assembling the package of Short’s belonging he
                sent to the media. Firstly, his name is either not going to be
                found in her belongings or, alternatively, the killer allows his
                name to be found only to be prepared to be interviewed and
                ‘cleared’ by the investigation (likely offering a plausible but
                hard to nail down alibi). Secondly, it is no accident that the
                Police discovers Hansen’s address book, a lead that sees them
                pursuing Hansen and his connections, wasting considerable time
                and effort. By ‘offering’ Hansen up to the Police in this way,
                the killer demonstrates a good level of knowledge of Elisabeth
                Short’s affairs (thus knowing that he would be a suspect that
                would be seen as viable by the Police). This is significant
                because it means that the killer knew Short to sufficient degree
                and was thus very likely not a stranger to her, making this not
                an opportunistic murder (such as for example in the case of Ted
                Bundy who was organized but opportunistic).
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                It is possible, but speculative, that if the killer had
                relatively significant knowledge of Short and her relationships,
                there might be a further reason why they decided to implicate
                Hansen. This might be due to multiple (not mutually excluding)
                factors such as: there was some animosity between the killer and
                Hansen, Hansen sad previously in some ways thwarted the killers
                plans or has acted as Short’s protector. Either way, the killer
                might be someone who was relatively close not only to Short but
                to Hansen as well.

                Organised offenders are very likely to work alone. However, it
                is possible that more than one person worked together to carry
                out this murder. Perhaps different individuals carried out the
                killing and the disposal of the body. Blunt force trauma is a
                statistically unlikely way of killing in cases where the body
                had been staged and posed, making the multiple killer scenario
                somewhat more feasible (in other words, Short might have died
                through the acts of a disorganized killer and her body was
                subsequently disposed of by an organised collaborator). Whilst
                possible, this is nevertheless unlikely unless supported by
                additional evidence. For example, one of the leading theories in
                relation to this case was that Short was killed in a brutal way
                at the Aster Motel by Leslie Dillon at the behest of Hansen. The
                problem with this theory, apart from other inconsistencies, is
                the clear disjoint between the death itself and the crime scene
                staged, including the acts of mutilations etc. following the
                death. In other words, the elaborate nature of post-mortem abuse
                of the body and the character of its staging make it unlikely
                that the person who carried the murder out did not get
                satisfaction from the act. Therefore, if the above Dillon theory
                was correct, the body would probably be disposed of in a less
                ritualistic manner.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                The crime scene was staged and the body was sexually posed. This
                is very significant because less than 1% of murders are sexually
                posed (i.e., the body was presented in a sexually provocative or
                enhanced way). Most often, sexual posing is not carried out to
                mislead the investigation, instead “the offenders' motivation
                was more often based on a psychological need for sexual
                fantasizing or to satisfy anger at the victim” (Geberth, 2010,
                p. 1). In this case the killer posed the victim’s body so that
                each of her arms was raised over her head at a 45-degree angle,
                the lower half of her severed body was positioned a foot over
                from her torso and her legs were positioned straight out, spread
                wide open, in a sexual way.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                According to Geberth (ibid.), there are three motives why a
                killer poses or positions the victim’s body in a sexual manner:
                to satisfy a perverse fantasy (sexual sadist rely on fantasy and
                ritual to obtain sexual satisfaction) – 71% of cases, out of
                anger or retaliation towards the victim (using sex and posing as
                a weapon to punish and degrade the victim) – 22% of cases, or to
                mislead the investigation and make it appear to be sexually
                motivated – 7% of cases. 98% of victims of staged murders are
                woman, 69% being white. 44% are a victim of a serial killer, and
                31% of rape/sodomy. The body is presented in nude in 69% of the
                cases.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                The most common modality of death in sexually posed cases is
                through both manual and ligature strangulation (71%, Gabarth
                2010). Although Short is believed to have died of blunt force
                trauma, there were signs of ligature on her body and she may
                have undergone a period of time being strangulated prior to
                being struck on the head. It is likely that there were multiple
                modalities that contributed to the death in this case. Combined
                injuries are common in cases of strangulation (77.3%), blunt
                trauma (64.3%) and sharp trauma (46.9%). Female victims died of
                combined injuries more frequently than males. This is likely
                because most femicides are cases of relational conflict causing
                extreme emotional outbursts and thus lead to the use of multiple
                aggressive traumatisations. The combination of the modalities of
                strangulation and blunt force trauma makes this murder likely to
                be personal, and more likely to be rage driven than phantasy
                driven.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                In the cases where the motivation for posing was
                anger/retaliation, the body was typically posed by spreading
                open the victim’s legs to expose the genitalia, insertion of
                objects into sexual orifices, and exposing the breasts. Thus,
                the exact post-mortem mutilation and manner of staging in the
                case of the Black Dahlia would indicate that the motivation for
                staging was out of anger/retaliation towards Short. The killer’s
                aim was to humiliate and degrade the victim. The killer wanted
                to expose Short figuratively and literally.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                This seems to be consistent with the killer’s communications to
                the media. The media was at the time in a frenzy of reporting
                about Short’s life in a campaign of victim-shaming, tied in with
                a macabre fascination with the killer. A good example of this
                fascination is George Hodel as a suspect - a dak and
                narcissistic figure shrouded in mystery and sexual allure. In
                their communications to the media, the killer congratulated to
                the editor of the LA Examiner on the coverage of the murder.
                More tellingly, there is an indication in his statement: "[I]
                Have changed my mind. You would not give me a square deal.
                Dahlia killing was justified." that he was wondering whether,
                perhaps, people will understand just why he killed Short should
                he surrender himself. In other words, it seems that the killer
                might have been entertaining the thought of surrendering himself
                because he understood that the public might agree with him as to
                the character of Short. This indicates anger/retaliation as the
                primary motive of the murder and staging of the body.

                The hemicorporectomy and exsanguination of the body were leads
                the Police pursued in detail. The precision of the bisection led
                Police to believe the killer must have had some experience in
                handling cadavers, such as doctors, dentists, mortician’s,
                people working in slaughterhouses, etc. A number of doctors and
                medical students found themselves on the suspect list, including
                Dr Hodel. A striking element in this case is that the body and
                the personal belongings sent were washed using gasoline. It is
                not very likely that any of the above professionals would choose
                gasoline for this job, they would arguably opt for other modes
                with which they were more familiar in their line of working.

            <p>
                Looking at the situation in which the Police, and the public,
                found themselves from a psychological perspective could help us
                understand why these groups of people were so appealing as
                suspects. Being faced with a murderer who was this controlled in
                the manner of dealing with the body caused great deal of
                psychological distress. A good defense against the thought that
                a person can go about and do such a thing is the idea that they
                can do this if they’re protected by their professional identity.
                This helps because it wasn’t X who did it, it was the ‘doctor in
                X’. And since I am not a doctor, people like me (i.e., all the
                people I know and associate with) would not have been able to do
                it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Thinking back to the socio-economic context of the crime, this
                was LA post WWII. There was a boom of optimism and a sense of a
                new beginning. Military personnel returning from the war were
                everyone’s heroes. Nobody at the time was too keen to think
                about the trauma these people have endured, this was best left
                unnamed. Prolonged traumatization or exposure to brutality is
                likely to leave people desensitized to the suffering of others.
                Witnessing bodies being maimed and brutalized is likely going to
                have a long-lasting impact on a person’s psychological make-up.
                Taken together, it’s safe to say that relying on the defense of
                professionalism and disregarding the traumatic social context of
                many men returning from warfare has hindered the investigation.
                Short was known to socialize with several soldiers in the months
                leading up to her death.
