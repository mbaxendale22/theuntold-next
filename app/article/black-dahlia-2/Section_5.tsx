            <h3>What happened to Elisabeth Short?</h3>
            <p>
                A young woman, with nothing in this world but her beauty,
                arrives in LA hoping this beauty will be enough to allow her to
                build a life for herself. But the road to having a life is paved
                by men and, unfortunately, when a woman relies on her beauty she
                inadvertently is letting herself down a dangerous pathway of
                being objectified and sexualized by men. Very rarely, women make
                it through and use this as a way of shaping their freedom and
                identity. Women such as Brigitte Bardot, Jane Fonda, Pamela
                Andreson, and – in more recent times – women who are attempting
                this such as Emily Ratajkowski and Megan Fox. The greatest
                danger on this road is that men expect certain things of their
                sexual objects, and will not tolerate other things

                The brutality of Short’s death transfixed the nation in 1947.
                This was the time of post-war optimism, the beginning of the
                boom of the suburban family lifestyle which will come to rule
                the social zeitgeist of the 50-ies. But, what <i>really</i>{' '}
                happened to Short is that she was a victim of a femicide. An
                angry killer savagely took from her the one thing she had – her
                beauty. And then put his act on display for the nation to be
                faced by the underbelly of the historical moment; the repressed
                violence of WWII, the loss of identity through rapid
                urbanization, the loss of respect of women through models served
                up by the new and booming entertainment industry. It’s
                interesting that Short’s death was more recently connected to
                the activities of the surrealist circle in LA (of which Hodel
                was a member). And surrealism probably <i>is</i> connected –
                through surrealist art being the only cultural niche where this
                latent, repressed violence and frustration was allowed out in
                the open. But this exposed surrealists as targets of
                externalization –{' '}
                <i>
                    it’s not me who is having these violent thoughts, it’s the
                    surrealists!
                </i>{' '}
                It should come as no surprise that Short’s murder remains
                unsolved.

                    “She didn’t seem to have any goals or standards… she never
                    had a job all the time she lived in Los Angeles. She had an
                    obviously low IQ, lived hand to mouth, day to day. They
                    found out during the autopsy that her teeth were full of
                    cavities. She had filled them up with candle wax. She was a
                    man-crazy tramp, but she wasn’t a prostitute. There were all
                    kinds of men in her life, but we were able to find three
                    who’d had any sexual experience with her. She was a tease;
                    she gave a bad time to quite a few guys. She just asked for
                    trouble. There wasn’t much to like about her.”
