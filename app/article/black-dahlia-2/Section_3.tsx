                Short’s life in LA – the known, the unknown, and the speculation
            </h3>

            <p>
                Short arrived in LA on August 20<sup>th</sup> with Gordon
                Fickling but they ended their relationship on the 26
                <sup>th</sup> of August and Short moved to the Hawthorne hotel
                with Marjorie Graham, a friend from Boston (they had bumped into
                each other by accident a couple of days prior). Short moved
                again on the 20<sup>th</sup> of September and registered with
                Marjorie at the downtown Hotel Figueroa. After 6 days there,
                they moved into the flat of Sid Zaid on Windsor Road for a few
                days before moving into the Florentine Gardens on Hollywood
                Boulevard at the end of September 1946. The Florentine Gardens
                were part-owned by Mark Hansen and this is where Short was
                introduced to him. They stayed at the Florentine Gardens until
                the 10<sup>th</sup> of October when they moved in with Bill
                Robinson and Marvin Margolis to Robinson’s aunt’s apartment, 726
                at the Guardian Arms on Hollywood Boulevard. According to
                Robinson and Margolis, Short was not romantically involved with
                either of them and was sleeping on the couch whilst Graham was
                sleeping on the bed with both men. Graham left LA and returned
                to Cambridge, Massachusetts on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of October.
                Short left the apartment on the same day, leaving her luggage
                behind. Up until this point, Graham had been a stable presence
                in Short’s life since her arrival in LA. Following Graham’s
                departure from LA, Short’s life was bound to become even more
                chaotic.

                On the 22<sup>nd</sup> of October, Short was spending time with
                Glen Stearns, an amateur photographer who she met recently.
                Stears took several photos of Short on that day. In the evening
                of the 22<sup>nd</sup> he drove her to Robinson’s apartment to
                collect her luggage. They spend most of the night driving around
                the San Fernando Valley where Short was unsuccessfully trying to
                find accommodation. In the early hours of October 23rd Short
                asked Stearns to drive her to Hansen’s home on Carlos Avenue.
                Anne Toth opened the door and let Short in. She stayed at
                Hansen’s until Anne Toth found and paid for her accommodation at
                the Chancellor on November 13<sup>th</sup> (after Hansen told
                her to leave following an argument).

            <br />
            <p>
                Short stayed at the Chancellor until December 6<sup>th</sup>{' '}
                when she, unbeknownst to anyone, left for San Diego. In fact,
                she made sure people were not aware of her whereabouts by
                telling them she was visiting with her sister up North. She
                arrived in San Diego without a plan and had nowhere to say. She
                met a young woman at a cinema whose family felt sorry for her
                and took her in. Short stayed with the family until January 8
                <sup>th</sup>, when she left in a hurry. Short spent the night
                of the 8<sup>th</sup> with Robert "Red" Manley who left her at
                the Biltmore hotel the next day.

                Short was a very vulnerable female living in LA on her own,
                surrounded by an often-unreliable network of people. For the
                most part, she has no constant or formal residence, drifting
                between different accommodations. There is no confirmed
                employment for Short during this period of time and it is not
                clear how Short was sustaining herself. During her stay at the
                Hawthorne in September, a short dark man about 35-40 driving a
                black Ford Sedan would pay Short’s bills when she wasn’t able
                to. Hansen said in his statement to the Police that he was
                reluctant to allow Short to stay at his property due to her
                always having “some undesirable looking character waiting for
                her outside and bringing her home”. Short was also known to come
                by money to pay for her expenses at the last minute, through
                unknown means.

                Short was particularly vulnerable in the ‘transition’ phases
                between different accommodations when she was, in effect,
                homeless for periods of time. During these times, it seems that
                very few, if any, people were aware of her whereabouts. As she
                didn’t have a reliable social circle, she was, effectively,
                completely isolated at those times from people who knew her.
                This made her vulnerable and desperate. To make matters worse,
                Short has spoken to different individuals about being afraid of
                someone (or more than one individual) but the identity of these
                people remains a mystery. Short inadvertently made her situation
                riskier through actively misleading people with regards to her
                whereabouts. She was probably trying to protect herself from
                whoever she was afraid of as she possibly wanted not to be
                found. It seems that Short had reasons to believe that the
                individual(s) she was afraid of had means to find out where she
                was from her friends. They were, perhaps, close to her friends
                or even within her social circle. The missing week, i.e. the one
                week in which there are no confirmed sightings of Short comes on
                a heel of one such transition period – her return from San Diego
                to LA. During this period, Short was not reported missing and it
                seems that no alarms were raised at all. It is possible that the
                killer was close enough to Short to be aware of her
                vulnerability at that time.

                There was mention of two men and a woman who have showed up at
                the house of the family Short was staying with in San Diego on
                the 7<sup>th</sup> of January whilst she was away from the home
                (perhaps prompting her rushed departure from San Diego). Two men
                and a woman were also involved in one of the last unconfirmed
                sightings of Short’s on the night of the 9<sup>th</sup> of
                January. A Police officer stated that a woman fitting Short’s
                description approached her panicked on the bus station near the
                Cecil Hotel stating that she is afraid of her ex-boyfriend who
                threatened to kill her should he see her with another man. On
                one account of this incident, the Police officer accompanies the
                young lady to an establishment where she stated the ex-boyfriend
                is and from where she run out without her belongings. The police
                officer then witnesses the young lady having a verbal
                confrontation with two ben and a woman before leaving the
                premises with the Police officer and stating to them that she
                will be fine because her father is picking her up and driving
                her home (out of LA). The Police officer couldn’t make a
                positive identification of the young woman being Short.

                There was a lot of speculation with regards to Short’s
                sexuality. Photos of 200 men were discovered in Shorts
                belongings, with numerous phone numbers and addresses. This has
                fueled the baseless speculation the Short was making a living as
                a prostitute. However, according to Sergeant Harry Hansen, one
                of the original detectives assigned to the murder, there was
                evidence that Short had any form of sexual relationship with
                three men only. From being a prostitute, Short quickly became a
                ‘tease’ of men and/or a lesbian. There were even theories that
                Short was not sexually intimate with men because she had some
                form of a deformity of her female organs. Amongst the many
                contacts in Short’s belongings there were several names and
                numbers of doctors and dentists in LA, some of whom where know
                to have been involved in illegal abortions (Dr. Hodel himself
                being one such person). This led to further theories of Short
                being pregnant and in need of an abortion circulating. The
                coroner concluded following the autopsy that she had never been
                pregnant, nor did she have any form of deformity of her female
                organs.

                Amongst the most bizarre statements made during the
                investigation is surely that of Dr. Melvin Schwartz, a dentist
                in his late 20-ies. He shared an office with Dr. Faught who
                would usually leave the premises around 3 or 4PM. After this
                time, Dr. Schwartz would assess Faught’s patients and ask them
                to come in the next they if he thought their appointment wasn’t
                urgent. According to Schwartz, one day a young woman came in the
                office when Faught was gone. When Schwartz asked her about the
                nature of her problem, she was reluctant to speak in the waiting
                area, so they went inside Faught’s office where she told
                Schwartz that she has an “inflamed gland”. She said Dr. Faught
                had once prior lanced her gland and she needed this done again.
                She said to Schwartz she believed to be allergic to rubber and
                that “every time I play around and have a rubber used on me, I
                get into this trouble”. According to Schwartz she then said to
                him that he is a good-looking doctor and, after he thanked her
                for the compliment, “she proceeded to grab my hand, she lifted
                her dress, and I pulled my hand away and stepped away from her.”
                At this point a nurse stepped into the office and “this lady in
                red disappeared”. Schwartz stated that Dr. Faught knew who this
                woman was and had said to him that she was a “streetwalker”.
                There is no mention of either Schwartz or Faught identifying
                Short as the young lady in question, but the story was waived in
                with the many narratives surrounding Short’s character.
